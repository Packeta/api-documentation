# Available delivery services

### Packeta pick-up delivery

We offer our own range of Packeta pick-up points that can be used for packet delivery. There are currently two types of these pick-up points:
- **pick-up points**
- **Z-BOXES**

\- **pick-up points** are physical shops for packet delivery. Our pick-up points support **COD** (cash on delivery) as well as reciever age checking and they can be used to both pick-up and consigned packets.

\- **Z-BOXES** are boxes for packet deliveries available 24/7. In order to take out packets from Z-boxes, you need to use our [mobile application ðŸ“±](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.zasilkovna.app&hl=en&gl=US)

:::info
Not all **pick-up points** can be used to consign packets. You can find out which pick-up points support consigning of packages using our [pick-up export](../pick-up-point-selection/branch-export-v5.mdx) -
specifically using the `packetConsignment` attribute.
:::

The recommended way of offering pick-up points to your customers is using our [widget](../pick-up-point-selection/widget.mdx).

You can find an example request for creating a packet headed to a Packeta pick-up [here](../packet-creation/packeta-pick-up-point.mdx)

### Address delivery

Packeta offers home delivery services in many countries using a large selection of carriers. A list of all available carriers can be obtained using our 
[address delivery export](../pick-up-point-selection/branch-export-v5.mdx#carriers-feed-address-delivery).

Each carrier has its own requirements and supported services, for example `COD`. You can find out the requirements and supported services using the above mentioned [address delivery export](../pick-up-point-selection/branch-export-v5.mdx#carriers-feed-address-delivery).

A specific carrier can be selected when creating a packet using the carrier's `addressID`, or you can choose to use our **Best delivery solution**. This service operates as a normal carrier on the outside 
(Meaning it has its own `addressId` and can be used as any other carrier when creating a packet), but internally, it encapsulates many different carriers. When using our **Best delivery solution**, our system will choose the best carrier automatically using our internal logic.

:::info
Best delivery solution isn't available in all countries. You can find out which countries support our Best delivery solution using our [address delivery export](../pick-up-point-selection/branch-export-v5.mdx#carriers-feed-address-delivery)
:::

:::info
When sending packets to home delivery use printing direct labels for your packets ( method packetCourierLabel). You can find more information on direct labels [here](./label-types.mdx#carrier-labels). If you send a packet to a carrier that supports carrier (direct) label printing,
 but you choose to print a Packeta label instead of the carrier label, your packet is subject to extra charges, since your packet will have to be re-labeled at our depot.

### Carrier pick-up delivery

Along with our own pick-up points, we also offer pick-up points of external carriers, since some carriers have their own networks of pick-up points or Boxes. Similarily to our pick-up points,
a list of carrier pick-up points can be obtained using our [carrier pick-up export](../pick-up-point-selection/carrier-pickup-points-export.mdx). Using this feed, you can download
a full list of **all** carrier pick-up points, or you can specify carrier IDs using a URL parameter when downloading the feed to only obtain pick-up points of a selected carrier/carriers.

Carriers, who offer their own pick-up points or boxes are marked in our [address delivery export](../pick-up-point-selection/branch-export-v5.mdx#carriers-feed-address-delivery) using attribute `pickupPoints`.

### Claim Assistant

**Claim Assistant** is a special type of packet that is used to allow your customers to return packets to the sender using a label that you provide.

:::info
There is a special sub-type of Claim Assistant that can be created only through our API using the [`createPacketClaimWithPassword()`](../api-reference/api-methods-reference.mdx#createpacketclaimwithpassword) method.
This type of Claim Assistant functions similarly to Return packets with the only difference being that each return packet has its unique password.
:::

### Return packet

**Return packet** is also a service that is used for return logistics, but instead of generating a new Claim assistant packet for each return, you only need to generate a single Return packet code
through our [client section](https://client.packeta.com/en/eshop-identifiers/edit). You can then provide this code to your customers, who can use it to return their packets. The customer doesn't have to print any
label when using this service, they only need to bring the packet to one of our Packeta pick-up points, tell the pick-up staff the Return packet code they obtained from the e-shop and the pick-up staff
will take care of the rest.
