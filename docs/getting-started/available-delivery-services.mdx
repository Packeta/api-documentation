# Available delivery services

### Packeta pick-up delivery

Our packet delivery options include a variety of Packeta pick-up points. These pick-up points fall into two categories:
- **Pick-up Points**
    - Often termed as PUDOs (an acronym for Pick-Up and Drop-Off points), represent specific physical locations for packet delivery. These points not only facilitate **COD** (Cash on Delivery) transactions but also implement recipient age verification. They can be used for both packet pick-up and drop-off.
- **Z-BOX**
    - Packet delivery boxes available 24/7. These boxes have keypads, facilitating the pick-up of packets without the need for our [mobile application ðŸ“±](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.zasilkovna.app&hl=en&gl=US). Although, the app remains necessary for **COD** (Cash on Delivery) transactions. Please note, age verification is not provisioned at Z-BOXes.

:::info
Not every pick-up point supports the consignment of packets. To identify which ones do, refer to our [pick-up point export](../pudo-delivery/packeta-pudos.mdx), particularly the `packetConsignment` attribute.

We advise providing pick-up point options to your customers through our [widget](../pudo-delivery/widget.mdx). This is the recommended approach.

### Home delivery

Packeta provides home delivery services across various countries via numerous carriers. To view all available carriers, please refer to our [carriers list](../pudo-delivery/packeta-pudos.mdx#carriers-list).

Each carrier supports different services and has unique requirements, such as `COD`. View the respective requirements and services for each carrier using the aforementioned [carriers list](../pudo-delivery/packeta-pudos.mdx#carriers-list).

When creating a packet, a specific carrier can be designated using its `addressID`, or alternatively, our **Best delivery solution (BDS)** can be utilized. Although it externally operates as a conventional carrier (i.e., it has its own `addressId` and can be used like any other carrier when creating a packet), internally it covers a variety of carriers. When the **Best delivery solution (BDS)** is selected, our system automatically picks the optimal carrier based on our proprietary algorithm.

:::info
**Best delivery solution (BDS)** is not supported in all countries. Refer to our [carriers list](../pudo-delivery/packeta-pudos.mdx#carriers-list) to see which countries accommodate this service.

:::info
 For home deliveries, use direct labels for your packets (method `packetCourierLabel`). More information on direct labels is in the [Carrier Labels](./label-types.mdx#carrier-labels) section. Selecting a carrier compatible with carrier labels but printing a Packeta label instead may lead to extra charges, as our depot will need to re-label the packet.

### Carrier pick-up delivery

In addition to Packeta PUDOs, we also provide the pick-up points or boxes of external carriers, as some of them have their own networks. Similar to our PUDOs, you can access the feed of carrier PUDOs through our [carriers' PUDOs feed](../pudo-delivery/carriers-pudos.mdx). This feed allows you to download a complete list of **all** carrier PUDOs. Moreover, you can filter the results by using a URL parameter to specify carrier IDs if you want to download the PUDOs of a specific carrier or carriers.

Carriers that provide their own pick-up points or boxes are designated in our [carriers list](../pudo-delivery/packeta-pudos.mdx#carriers-list) using the `pickupPoints` attribute.

### Claim Assistant

The **Claim Assistant** is a unique packet type, designed to facilitate customers in returning packets to the sender using a label supplied by you.

There's a unique subtype of Claim Assistant that can exclusively be created via our API using the [`createPacketClaimWithPassword()`](../api-reference/api-methods-reference.mdx#createpacketclaimwithpassword) method. This version functions similar to Return packets with the only distinction being that each return packet possesses a unique password.

### Return packet

The **Return packet** is another service designed for return logistics. Unlike the Claim assistant packet which requires a new generation for each return, you only need to generate a single Return packet code. This can be done through our [client section](https://client.packeta.com/en/eshop-identifiers/edit), and you can then pass on this code to your customers for packet return. Using this service, customers don't need to print any label. They simply have to take the packet to any of our Packeta pick-up points, tell the staff the Return packet code provided by the e-shop, and we will handle the rest.
