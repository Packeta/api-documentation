# Label Types

Packeta provides two distinct label types: **Packeta labels** and **Carrier labels**. The type you choose to use will depend on the services you decide to implement.

## Packeta Labels

**Packeta labels** are labels directly generated from our system, meaning no third party is involved in their creation. These labels are versatile and can be used for all packet types. Also, they are available in a wide variety of different formats.

Please note, while you can use these labels for all packets, if your packet is destined for an external carrier, our depot will replace the Packeta label with the carrier's label.

### Packeta label example
<div style={{display: "flex", justifyContent: "center"}}>
    <img src="/img/exampleLabel.png" width="700"/>
</div>

## Carrier labels 

**Carrier labels** are labels from external carriers. These labels aren't generated within our system but retrieved from the carriers themselves. Hence, carrier labels are only available for packets directed to an external carrier or a carrier pick-up point.

For packets sent to external carriers or carrier pick-up points, we **strongly advise** using carrier labels instead of Packeta labels. If you opt to use our Packeta labels in this scenario, they would be replaced with the carrier's labels at our depot. This could potentially result in slower delivery times and extra charges.

:::info
Not all carriers support direct label printing. You can check which carriers do using our [carriers list](../pudo-delivery/packeta-pudos#carriers-feeds-home-delivery) and considering the `apiAllowed` parameter. If a carrier doesn't support direct label printing, and you use Packeta labels, there will be no additional charges.
:::

:::caution
Obtaining indirect labels for packets to carriers is now deprecated and will be disallowed in the future. As a replacement, you should implement a method for carrier labels using either `packetCourierLabelPdf/Png` or `packetCourierLabelsPdf/Png`.

### Carrier label example

Please remember, we collaborate with a diverse range of carriers, each providing its unique label. Consequently, **labels from various carriers will visually differ**. An example of Slovenia Post Home Delivery's label is provided below for your reference.
