# Packetery API

We offer API interface using [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) protocol or a REST interface using XML request bodies. Both offer the same functionality.

Please see [API reference](../api-reference/api-methods-reference) for more details.

## SOAP

- WSDL: https://soap.api.packeta.com/api/soap.wsdl
- WSDL for PHP (32bit): https://soap.api.packeta.com/api/soap-php-bugfix.wsdl

:::warning
Native PHP SoapClient on 32bit systems fails at processing 64bit integers; please use the bugfix WSDL for PHP, where the `unsignedLong` type is replaced by `string`. **It is important to treat packet IDs as** `string`, since the standard `signedInt` would not be able to contain the value.
:::

Example:

```csharp
using System;
using System.ServiceModel;

namespace ConsoleApplication1
{
	using Packetery;
	class Program
	{
		static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			Packetery.PacketeryClient gw = new PacketeryClient();
			string apiPassword = "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef";

			PacketAttributes attrs = new PacketAttributes();
			attrs.number = "123456";
			attrs.name = "John";
			attrs.surname = "Doe";
			attrs.email = "example@packetatest.com";
			attrs.phone = "+420777123456";
			attrs.addressId = 79; //Praha 4, Pražského povstání, Na Pankráci 969/97
			attrs.cod = 145;
			attrs.value = 145.55;
			attrs.weight = 2;
			attrs.eshop = "MyEshop";

			PacketIdDetail packet;
			try
			{
				packet = gw.createPacket(apiPassword, attrs);
			}
			catch (FaultException<PacketAttributesFault> e) {
				// TODO: process error
			}
		}
	}
}
```

```php
<?php
$gw = new SoapClient("https://soap.api.packeta.com/api/soap.wsdl");
$apiPassword = "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef";

try {
	$packet = $gw->createPacket($apiPassword, array(
		'number' => "123456",
		'name' => "John",
		'surname' => "Doe",
		'email' => "example@packetatest.com",
		'phone' => "+420777123456",
		'addressId' => 79,
		'cod' => 145,
		'value' => 145.55,
		'weight' => 2,
		'eshop' => "MyEshop"
	));
} catch (SoapFault $e) {
	var_dump($e->detail); // property detail contains error info
}
```

## REST/XML

- API URL: https://www.zasilkovna.cz/api/rest

Always send a POST request with a XML document body, using the requested API method as the root element's name and method's arguments as subelements.

Example:
```xml
<createPacket>
	<apiPassword>__API_PASSWORD__</apiPassword>
	<packetAttributes>
		<number>123456</number>
		<name>John</name>
		<surname>Doe</surname>
		<email>example@packetatest.com</email>
		<addressId>79</addressId>
		<value>145.55</value>
		<weight>2</weight>fixed
		<eshop>MyEshop</eshop>
	</packetAttributes>
</createPacket>
```

The server response follows the same rules as the request, except the root element is the name of the return type.

## Testing

**You can freely use your standard account for testing purposes**. We do not charge anything for packets that were not physically consigned to one of our branches.

However if you insist on testing on a different account (you don't wish to pollute your packet history), just ask e-commerce.support@packeta.com for one.
