# Client section

## Overview

If you don't want to implement our API for the purposes of creating packets, you can use semi-automate process for creating packets - our [Client section](https://client.packeta.com/) packet import instead.

Our client section supports packet imports in two file formats:
- `CSV`
- `XML`

You fill find more details about each format below.

## CSV import

### Basic guidelines

In **[Client section](http://client.packeta.com)** there is an option to upload a CSV file containing packet data.
:::info
CSV file is not suitable to import packets with mandatory **customs declarations**. In that case the better option is the **[XML import](#xml-import)** (otherwise customs declarations have to be **filled in manually** afterwards). 
:::


The file needs to conform to the following rules:

- First two rows of the file are header rows and:

    - First row needs to contain the string `version 7` at first position (first cell). The rest is ignored.
    - Second row is ignored.
- The third row of the file is the first packet-data row.
- Allowed separators are comma `,` and semicolon `;` characters.
- Allowed decimal point separators are dot `.` and comma `,`. Comma must be within quotes `"` if comma `,` is already used as CSV separator.
- Optionally, the cell content can be quoted using double quote `"` characters.

:::info
To use double quote as a part of the value, i.e. name is `Jeff "the Dude" Lebowski`, you need to escape the quote **by doubling it**. The name from previous example should then look like this: `Jeff ""the Dude"" Lebowski`.
:::

- Accepted file encoding is `UTF-8`.
- Whitespace characters will be stripped from the beginning and the end of the value.


## Fields reference

## XML import

### Basic guidelines

In **[Client section](http://client.packeta.com)** there is an option to upload a XML file containing packet data. It is suitable for import complete packet data including customs declaration.

The file needs to conform to the following rules:

- The structure of the file has to correspond to the **[XML schema definition](https://client.packeta.com/assets/schemas/packetImport_v1.xsd)** which contains brief descriptions of particular fields.
- Currently supported version is `1`.
- Accepted file encoding is `UTF-8`.
