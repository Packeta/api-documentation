# Client section

## Overview

If you're unable or prefer not to use our API for packet creation, we have an alternative - a semi-automated packet creation process through our [Client section](https://client.packeta.com/) for packet import.

In our client section, we support packet imports in the following file formats:
- `CSV`
- `XML`
- `XLS`

:::caution
- Both CSV and XML files must follow the respective technical documentation. Alternatively, you can opt for XLS, XLSX, or ODT files, which need to meet the same criteria as CSV or XML files.
- Ensure all data and source files being uploaded comply with UTF-8 encoding. This encoding is critical to validate and transmit electronic data across carriers globally.
:::

You can find more details about each format in the sections below.

## CSV import

### Basic guidelines

Within the **[Client Section](https://client.packeta.com/cs/packets-import/upload)**, you have the option to upload a CSV file comprising of packet data.

:::caution
If your packets require mandatory **customs declarations**, a CSV file might not be suitable for the import. In such cases, the **[XML import](#xml-import)** option would be a better choice; otherwise, customs declarations would need to be **filled in manually** at a later stage.
:::

The file must adhere to these rules:
- The file encoding must be `UTF-8`.
- Acceptable separators include the comma `,` or semicolon `;` characters.
- Acceptable decimal point separators are the dot `.` and comma `,`. If the comma is used as the CSV separator, a comma inside quotes `"` must be used instead.
- Any whitespace characters at the beginning or end of the value will be removed.
- The first two rows of the file serve as header rows:
    - The first row should have the string `version 7` at the first position (first cell). Any additional content in this row is not considered.
    - The second row is not considered.
- The third row of the file begins the packet-data rows.
- Optionally, you can enclose the cell content within double quote `"` characters. If you need to include a double quote as part of the value, such as in `John "Billy" Doe`, you should escape the quote by **doubling it**. Following this rule, the name in the previous example should appear as `John ""Billy"" Doe`.

## XML import

### Basic guidelines

In the **[Client section](http://client.packeta.com)**, you have the option to upload an XML file that contains packet data. This is ideal for importing complete packet data, including customs declarations.

The file must adhere to these rules:
- The file encoding must be `UTF-8`.
- Currently supported version is `1`.
- The structure of the file has to correspond to the **[XML schema definition](https://client.packeta.com/assets/schemas/packetImport_v1.xsd)** which contains brief descriptions of particular fields.
