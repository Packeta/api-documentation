# Overview

For packet shipping outside of the EU, you'll need to furnish necessary data for the customs clearance process.

:::info
For any questions regarding customs procedures that are not covered in this section of the documentation, you can contact our customs department at customs@packeta.com

## Basic information

### Customs clearance options

We offer our clients 3 options for the customs export clearance:
1. Self-declaration: If clients have their own export document or an EAD. In this case, the EAD needs to be uploaded into the system when submitting the packet and forwarded via email to customs@packeta.com along with the packet ID.
2. Procurement of a customs declaration via ZÃ¡silkovna/Packeta (according to the valid price list).
3. Customs clearance via a partner carrier (without the customs export document and additional charges).

### Required administrative
For options 1 and 2, to permit packet shipping, it's essential for us to receive a completed and signed document of Power of Attorney for Indirect representation in customs proceedings, supplemented with a valid EU EORI.


#### TARIC code (the integrated Tariff of the European Union)
This refers to the 8-digit identification of goods for trade, namely the combined nomenclature based on the HS code and a two-digit description added. For comprehensive information about the TARIC code for specific goods, consult the [TARIC Consultation](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/taric_consultation.jsp?Lang=en) and explore the nomenclature.


#### Packet weight
The data about packet weight for customs declaration must be as precise as can be. In the customs declaration, clients provide the net weight of the goods being transported (meaning the weight of the item without its packaging included).

:::info
Every carrier might need distinct details for their customs clearance procedure.
You can locate a list of necessary information for each carrier in the [Customs Documentation](https://client.packeta.com/assets/documentation/Customs-documentation-en.pdf).

## How to declare customs data

### Client section
While creating packets via our [Client section](https://client.packeta.com/), a customs declarations form will appear automatically once you pick an eligible carrier.

### API
While creating packets with customs declarations through our API, please use the [`Item`](../../api-reference/data-structures-reference.mdx#item) and [`Attribute`](../../api-reference/data-structures-reference.mdx#attribute) data structures.
A list of possible `Item` and `Attribute` values is available in the [Items and Attributes Reference](./items-and-attributes-reference.mdx).

A [`createPacket()`](../../api-reference/api-methods-reference.mdx#createpacket) request sample with customs declarations is provided in the [Home Delivery with Customs Data](../home-delivery#home-delivery-with-customs-data) section.
