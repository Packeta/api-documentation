## Basic information

### Customs clearance options

There are 3 options of customs export clearance that our clients can take advantage of:
1. Self-declaration (clients have their own export document or an EAD), where the EAD must be
uploaded into the system upon packet submission and sent via email to customs@packeta.com
along with the packet ID.
2. Issuing a customs declaration via ZÃ¡silkovna/Packeta (according to the valid price list).
3. Customs clearance through a partner carrier (without the customs export document and fees).

### Required administrative
When choosing option 1 or 2, in order to have packet shipping approved, we require a filled-out and signed Power
of Attorney for Indirect representation in customs proceedings document, along with a valid EU EORI.

#### TARIC code (the integrated Tariff of the European Union)
Meaning the 8-digit designation of traded goods, or the so-called combined nomenclature based on the HS code
and supplemented by a two-digit description. For detailed information about the TARIC code for particular goods,
click [HERE](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/taric/taric_consultation.jsp?Lang=en) and browse the nomenclature.


#### packet weight
Information about packet weight in customs declaration must be as accurate as possible. In the customs declaration, clients fill out the net weight of the transported goods (meaning the actual weight without packaging).

:::info
Each carrier may require different information for their customs clearance process. You can find a list af required information for each carrier [here](https://client.packeta.com/assets/documentation/Customs-documentation-en.pdf)
