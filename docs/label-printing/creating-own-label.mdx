# Creating own packet label

If you choose to create your own packet labels, it is crucial to incorporate all of the essential data.

:::caution
Regardless of whether a custom label is being used, it is mandatory to provide the packet data via the API using the [`createPacket`](../api-reference/api-methods-reference#createpacket) method.
