# Widget
This document details the standard implementation of Packeta Home Delivery (HD) address selection utilizing an embeddable application. We recommend embedding the application using the integration library outlined below.

## Supported browser versions

List of minimal supported browser versions:
- Google Chrome 79
- Mozilla Firefox 79
- Microsoft Edge 18
- Safari 11
- Opera 70

## Intended audience

This manual is intended for technically advanced internet stores which require and are able to implement custom interaction with the widget.

Specifically, the following skills are required:
- Basic JavaScript programming
- Basic HTML/CSS knowledge

## Getting Started – Examples

We offer an integration library to simplify the process of embedding the widget into your website. You're free to make a copy of it (although it won't have automatic updates) or use it however you wish:
- [library.js](https://hd.widget.packeta.com/v6/www/js/library.js)
- Here are some examples using the library: [simple](https://hd.widget.packeta.com/doc/standard-example-simple-hd.html), [complex](https://hd.widget.packeta.com/doc/standard-example-complex-hd.html), [combination](https://hd.widget.packeta.com/doc/standard-example-together.html)
- Remember to insert your API key (look for ``packetaApiKey``) for the examples to function correctly
    - Your API key is a unique identifier tied to your Packeta account, which can be found in the [Packeta Client Section](https://client.packeta.com/) or provided by your account manager.

## Basic embeddable application implementation details
The embeddable application exists within an isolated iframe, which can only interact with your main webpage through sending messages via ``window.postMessage()``.

The application will utilize the parameters of the pick function, denoted further below, as query string parameters for the iframe. For instance, [https://hd.widget.packeta.com/#/?layout=hd&carrierId=80&apiKey=XXXXXXXXXXXXX&country=cz,sk](https://hd.widget.packeta.com/#/?layout=hd&carrierId=80&apiKey=**XXXXXXXXXXXXX**&country=cz,sk) (note this is just an example - you must input your own API Key for the widget to function properly)

**Permissions for Iframe:**

- recommended: ``sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin" allow="geolocation"``
- minimal requirement: ``sandbox="allow-scripts"``
- be aware that geolocation is only available if your online store operates over https (not just http)
- persistence of cookies

**The shopping cart has two unique operational modes:**

1. Selection of the pick-up point happens within a modal dialog (this opens after the customer opts for delivery to a Packeta pick-up point, or via a button next to such a delivery method)
1. Inline UI controls, incorporated as part of the selection process for the delivery method
The application supports both modes. When implementing the latter, ensure compatibility with mobile phones and tablets through thorough testing.

## Integration library – methods

We provide an integration library available at this URL:
- https://hd.widget.packeta.com/www/js/library.js

The library provides following methods:

```
Packeta.Widget.pick(apiKey, callback, options, inElement)
```

This method launches the widget.
There is no return value.

|**Argument**|**Type**|**Required**|**Description**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|``apiKey``|``string[16]``|yes|An identifier of your Packeta account, available in Packeta Client section, or can be provided by your account manager.|
|``callback``|``function``|yes|Function which will be called when the user confirms or cancels delivery address selection. The function will receive one argument, which will be either an [Return values](#return-values) object if delivery address was selected, or null if selection was cancelled.|
|``options``|``Object`` [Options](#options)|yes|Additional configuration options of the application, see below.|
|``inElement``|``DOM element``|no|If not null, application will be displayed inside the specified DOM element. We recommend that the element has dimensions specified.|

```
Packeta.Widget.close()
```

Close any previously displayed widget. This method will succeed even if none is currently open.
There is no return value ``address``.
