# Overview

Before you are able to create pick-up point packets, you first have to be able to let your customers choose their preferred pick-up point. You can do this in two ways:
1. [Widget](widget) (**recommended**)
2. [Data feeds](branch-export-v5)

## Widget

Our Widget is a ready-made solution, that can be easily embedded into your eshop. It can be used to offer both Packeta pick-up points, as well as Carrier pick-up points.

The main advantages of Widget over feed are:
- **Less maintanance** - you don't have to keep a database of our/carrier pick-up points
- **Easy and fast implementation**
- **A standard look accross many eshops** - better experience for the end-user

If you would like widget implementation examples for Packeta pick-up points or Carrier pick-up points, you can find them [here](examples/packeta-pickup-points#using-widget) and [here](examples/carrier-pickup-points#using-widget) respectively.

You can find a comprehensive guide on how to implement our widget in the [Widget](widget) section.

## Data feeds

If you wish to build your own solution for offering pick-up points to end users, you can use our data feeds to obtain raw pick-up point data from our API.

We have two data feeds:
1. [Branch export](branch-export-v5)
2. [Carrier pick-up points export](carrier-pickup-points-export)

When using data feeds, its important that you update your data every hour.

:::caution
Data feeds were not designed to be used in conjunction with our Widget. Please, do not validate data obtained form our widget with data from our feed, if possible.
:::

### Branch export

[Branch export](branch-export-v5) contains data for all our Packeta pick-up points, as well as address delivery carriers.

### Carrier pick-up points export

[Carrier pick-up points export](carrier-pickup-points-export) contains carrier pick-up points data.
