# Packeta Pick-up points

### Using Widget
To implement our Widget into your website, we recommend using our integration library located at 
[https://widget.packeta.com/v6/www/js/library.js](https://widget.packeta.com/v6/www/js/library.js)

You may mirror this library locally, but you won't receive any updates, so we recommend linking this library into your website dynamically using

```html
<script src="https://widget.packeta.com/v6/www/js/library.js"></script>
```

:::note
We have created a variation of our `library.js` which can be used by e-shops which validate file integrity. You can find this version [here](https://widget.packeta.com/v6/www/js/library-1.0.0.js) 
:::

To open the widget window, the library provides the `Packeta.Widget.pick(apiKey, callback, options*, inElement*)` method.

Below, you will find an example widget implementation for offering Packeta pick-up points:


<iframe 
  height="800" 
  style={{width: "100%"}} 
  scrolling="no" 
  title="widget--packeta-pick-up-points"
  src="https://codepen.io/zeecapp/embed/wvpVMZX?default-tab=result&editable=true&theme-id=light"
  frameborder="no" 
  loading="eager" 
  allowtransparency="true" 
  allowfullscreen="true"
  sandbox>
            See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/zeecapp/pen/wvpVMZX">
            widget--packeta-pick-up-points</a> by Honza L. (<a href="https://codepen.io/zeecapp">@zeecapp</a>)
            on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.
</iframe>

:::tip
Choose a pick-up point using the Widget above and open the developer console of your browser to see the object our widget returns upon pick-up point selection.

You can also try inserting your own API key in the JS section of the fiddle.
:::

### Using data feed
To download the data of currently available Packeta pick-up points, you can use our
[`Branch export`](../branch-export-v5). This data can be used to build
your own solution for offering pick-up points to your customers.

The URLs for downloading Packeta pick-up point data are
```html
<!--for XML data-->
https://www.zasilkovna.cz/api/v4/__API_KEY__/branch.xml?lang=__LANGUAGE__
<!--for JSON data-->
https://www.zasilkovna.cz/api/v5/__API_KEY__/branch.json?lang=__LANGUAGE__
```

[`Branch export`](../branch-export-v5) data is updated every hour, so we recommend
our clients to update their pick-up point data at least every hour.

:::warning
Not updating your pick-up point data periodically may cause problems during the packet creation process.
