# Widget
This document contains information regarding standard implementation of Packeta Home Delivery (HD) address selection using an embeddable application. Please embed the application using the integration library described bellow.

## Supported browser versions

List of minimal supported browser versions:
- Google Chrome 79
- Mozilla Firefox 79
- Microsoft Edge 18
- Safari 11
- Opera 70

## Intended audience

This manual is intended for technically advanced internet stores which require and are able to implement custom interaction with an embeddable application.

Specifically, the following skills are required:
- basic JavaScript programming
- basic HTML/CSS knowledge

## Quick start – examples

We provide an integration library that will help you with the embedding of the widget to your website, which you **may** mirror (without automatic updating) and/or use in any way:
- [library.js](https://hd.widget.packeta.com/v6/www/js/library.js)
- example using the library: [simple](https://hd.widget.packeta.com/doc/standard-example-simple-hd.html), [complex](https://hd.widget.packeta.com/doc/standard-example-complex-hd.html), [combination](https://hd.widget.packeta.com/doc/standard-example-together.html)
- please note you have to provide your API key (search for ``packetaApiKey``) for the examples to work
  - API key is an identifier of your Packeta account, available in Packeta client section, or can be provided by your account manager

## Basic embeddable application implementation details

The embeddable application lives in an isolated iframe, which cannot interact with your main webpage in any other way than sending messages using ``window.postMessage()``.

The embedable application will use the parameters of the pick function mentioned bellow as query string parameters of the iframe. e.g. https://hd.widget.packeta.com/v6/#/?layout=hd&carrierId=80&apiKey=c65a2d0ee3cb844f&country=cz,sk (this is just example - use your own ApiKey for the correct functioning of the widget, allowed countries, etc.)

**Iframe permissions:**

- recommended: ``sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin" allow="geolocation"``
- minimal required: ``sandbox="allow-scripts"``
- please note that geolocation is only available if your internet store is served over https (not just http)
- cookies persistence

**There are two distinct possible modes of operation in the shopping cart:**

1. the pick-up point selection is done in a modal dialog (which opens after the customer selects delivery to Packeta pick-up point, or by a button available next to such delivery method)
1. inline UI controls, part of delivery method selection
Both modes are supported by the application. When doing the later, make sure to test on mobile phones and tablets.

## Integration library – methods

We provide an integration library available at this URL:
- https://hd.widget.packeta.com/www/js/library.js

The library provides following methods:

```
Packeta.Widget.pick(apiKey, callback, options, inElement)
```

This method launches the widget.
There is no return value.

|**Argument**|**Type**|**Required**|**Description**|
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
|``apiKey``|``string[16]``|yes|An identifier of your Packeta account, available in Packeta client section, or can be provided by your account manager.|
|``callback``|``function``|yes|Function which will be called when the user confirms or cancels delivery address selection. The function will receive one argument, which will be either an [Return values](https://docs.packetery.com/07-home-delivery/01-impl-man/#return-values) object if delivery address was selected, or null if selection was cancelled.|
|``options``|``Object`` [Options](https://docs.packetery.com/07-home-delivery/01-impl-man/#options)|yes|Additional configuration options of the application, see below.|
|``inElement``|``DOM element``|no|If not null, application will be displayed inside the specified DOM element. We recommend that the element has dimensions specified.|

```
Packeta.Widget.close()
```

Close any previously displayed widget. This method will succeed even if none is currently open.
There is no return value ``address``.
