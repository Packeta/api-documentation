# Carriers' PUDOs

### Using Widget
Implementation of our widget to display carrier PUDOs on your website follows the identical procedure as that for integrating our widget to present Packeta pick-up points described above. By default, our widget attempts to showcase both our Packeta pick-up points and carrier PUDOs. This behaviour can be altered using the [`vendors`](../widget#options) option during the invocation of `Packeta.Widget.pick()` method from our integration library.

If this option is left blank, the widget will present both Packeta and carrier PUDOs. Entering `"packeta"` into this option will exclusively display Packeta pick-up points. Correspondingly, including an ID of an external carrier will yield only that carrier's pick-up points. The [carriers list](../packeta-pudos.mdx#carriers-list) can be referred to identify carriers with their own pick-up points.

Below is an example of widget implementation for presenting carrier PUDOs:

<iframe
    height="800"
    style={{width: "100%"}}
    scrolling="no"
    title="Widget implementation - Carrier PUDOs"
    src="https://codepen.io/Packeta/embed/xxNRWEN?default-tab=result"
    frameborder="no"
    loading="lazy"
    allowtransparency="true"
    allowfullscreen="true"
    sandbox>

</iframe>

:::tip
Utilize the Widget above to select a pick-up point, and then open your browser's developer console to view the object returned by our widget upon selection of a pick-up point.

Additionally, you have the option to insert your own API key in the JS section of the fiddle.

### Using data feed
Our [Packeta PUDOs feed](../packeta-pudos) used for fetching pick-up point data does not include carrier PUDOs data. Given that delivery to carrier PUDOs and delivery to Packeta pick-up points are distinctive services, carrier PUDOs are housed in a separate data feed.

You can acquire carrier PUDOs using our [Carriers' PUDOs feed](../carriers-pudos)
```html
<!--for JSON data-->
https://pickup-point.api.packeta.com/api/v5//__API_KEY__/point.json?ids=__BRANCH_IDS__
```

:::danger[Warning]
Not updating your carriers' pick-up point data regularly can lead to issues during the packet creation process. We recommend updating these data once a day.
:::

You have the option to specify the IDs of specific carriers using the `ids` parameter. This action will result in the export only including pick-up points belonging to the indicated carriers. If no `ids` are specified, PUDOs from all carriers will be downloaded.

The data retrieved in this manner can serve the development of your custom solution for providing carrier PUDOs to your customers.
